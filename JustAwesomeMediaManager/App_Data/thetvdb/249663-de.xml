  <Overview>So you think you know Albert Einstein? Clever guy, crazy hair, had a few ideas about space and time - that's the one.

Well, James May thought he knew him pretty well too, until he started asking some really tough questions. How did a man falling off a roof change our universe? What does E=mc2 actually mean? Who wanted Einstein for president? And furthermore, what happened to his brain?

To help James find out, he will enter a universe of bizarre animation and motion graphics, where atom bombs and speeding trains collide with photons and monkeys' earwax. Along the way, he uncovers a world of facts that will surprise, amaze and entertain you - and you don't have to be a genius to enjoy it!</Overview>

  <Overview>You might relish cabbage about as much as a two month bout of chickenpox, but would you consider it as a leafy long lost relative? James May does, thanks to the genius of a man who changed the world, Charles Darwin.

But exactly how does Darwin's famous theory of natural selection explain why we are all mutants and what war is actually good for? James treks off into the wilderness with the natural advantage of fantastic motion graphics and vivid animation, to show us just how.</Overview>

  <Overview>Have you ever wondered if certain chemicals can make you irresistible to the opposite sex? Well James May certainly has, and with the help of dynamic motion graphics, he distils the sensuous secrets and explains how our world is really just one big laboratory as he reveals all you need to know about chemisty.

Join James as he discovers what sorcerers and scientists have wondered for centuries - whether we can turn lead into gold - and just maybe, shares chemistry's secret to eternal life. Along the way, he reveals how what you flush down your toilet could actually be making you money, how the booze in your bottle could power a jet and why the elements in the periodic table are just like us - they don't all get along.</Overview>
