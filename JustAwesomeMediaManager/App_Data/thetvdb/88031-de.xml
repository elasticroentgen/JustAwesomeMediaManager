  <Overview>Dragonball Kai ist eine &quot;aufgefrischte&quot; Version der alten Dragonball Z-Folgen, die am 5. April 2009 um 9:00 auf dem japanischen Fernsehsender Fuji TV ihre Premiere feierte. Zu den Ã„nderungen der als &quot;Akira Toriyama Original Cut&quot; beworbenen Serie gehÃ¶ren der Wegfall der meisten Filler-Szenen, neu aufgenommene Dialoge, neue Musik, erneuerte Sound-Effekte und neue digitale Effekte. Die Handlung der Neufassung beginnt mit Inhalten aus dem Fernsehspecial, das in Deutschland auf DVD unter dem Titel &quot;Das Bardock Special&quot; erschien. Es zeigt die Vorgeschichte um die Vernichtung der Saiyajin durch Freezer und enthÃ¤lt zur Einleitung auch Footages aus der ersten Fernsehserie, ehe die eigentliche Handlung zum gleichen Zeitpunkt wie im Original einsetzt.</Overview>

  <Overview>Long ago, Bardock, a Saiyan warrior died in an attempt to stop Freeza, a galactic tyrant who ruled over the vast reaches of space. But before Freeza destroys Bardock's home planet, one space pod seems to have escaped only moments beforehand. Kakarrot, Bardock's son, had escaped the planet's explosion and was sent to Earth to follow through with Freeza's orders of conquering it. Upon crash landing on Earth, however, Kakarrot is found by an elderly man, Son Gohan, who raises him as his own, naming him Son Goku. Years pass and Goku ends up serving as Earth's greatest protector, completely unaware of his Saiyan heritage. But it seems that Goku is not the only survivor of his home planet, as another Saiyan has reached Earth to remind him of his true purpose. </Overview>

  <Overview>Goku, Krillin, and Gohan are in the hospital recovering from the battle with Vegeta. Their friends and family come visit. When the television is turned on, they see a report about Nappa's Space-Pod. Bulma, thinking she's pressed the button that will have it fly towards them, instead self-destructs the pod. Before everyone gives up hope, Mr. Popo arrives, and tells them that he knows of another spaceship. It's the Namekian ship that Kami used to come to earth when he was a boy. Bulma reluctantly agrees to inspect it up in Yunzabit Heights with him. They realize the craft is voice-activated in the native Namekian language. Bulma converts the language to english in a few weeks with Gohan and Krillin deciding to accompany her on her journey to planet Namek in search for the Dragon Balls. </Overview>

  <Overview>While on their journey to Namek, Gohan and Krillin practice image training. Meanwhile, Vegeta has landed on Planet Frieza No. 79, and after being revived, heads to Namek to collect the Dragon Balls once Kui tells him Lord Frieza is currently there. After 30 days aboard Kami's old space-vessel, Bulma, Krillin, and Gohan arrive on Namek. Bulma uses her scouter and notices that four of the seven dragon balls are together already. Gohan senses evil ki, but Bulma reassures them that the Namekians probably are the ones who have them. They notice Vegeta's spacepod fly overhead and land in the distance, along with a second spacepod shortly after. Vegeta isn't too thrilled to find out Zarbon and Dodoria are also accompanying Frieza. </Overview>

  <Overview>Vegeta, Krillin, and Gohan race to the remaining five Dragon Balls that Vegeta had hidden, in an attempt to grant Vegeta the wish of eternal life, in order to stand a chance against the Ginyu Force. The Ginyu Force beats them there, and with speed and a time freeze, swipe the two remaining Dragon Balls. Captain Ginyu takes the seven Dragon Balls to Frieza, and allows the other members to play Rock-Paper-Scissors to decide who gets to fight who. Recoome wins a fight with Vegeta and Guldo wins a fight with Krillin and Gohan. Krillin and Gohan fight Guldo first. After proving that they are no easy match for him, Guldo paralyzes the two with his ESP. Vegeta kills Guldo before any harm is done to the Earthlings, so Recoome decides he's next to fight. Meanwhile, Goku is ten minutes from landing on Namek.</Overview>

  <Overview>Vegeta begins battling Recoome, the big brute of the Ginyu Force. While the Saiyan prince manages to get in a few good blows, ultimately Recoome doesn't seem to be taking any pain. Gohan and Krillin enter battle after Vegeta becomes too badly injured to continue fighting, but quickly find themselves beaten and outclassed by the hulking Ginyu Force member as well. Meanwhile, Frieza attempts to use the Dragon Balls but nothing happens, prompting him to leave Ginyu to guard the balls while he himself goes to look for Namekians to tell him how to become immortal. Just when all seems lost in Vegeta, Krillin and Gohan's fight with Recoome, Goku's Capsule Corporation ship finally touches down on Planet Namek.</Overview>

  <Overview>Goku enters the battle after giving Senzus to Krillin, Gohan, and Vegeta, and things quickly take a turn for the better. Recoome, charging up a deadly attack, is defeated by a single blow from Goku. Jeice and Burter leap into battle trying a variety of techniques - none of which have the least bit of effect on Goku. Burter is knocked out by a few swift attacks from Goku, as Jeice stares in awe at his latest opponent - having never faced someone so powerful.</Overview>

  <Overview>Goku powers up to his maximum level - which is far greater than that of even Captain Ginyu! Yet, for some strange reason, Goku's current enemy doesn't seem too worried. After the Eldest Namek gives Dende a mysterious new power and sends him off to meet the Earthlings, Nail begins battling Frieza. While Frieza is clearly the stronger of the two, he is surprised at Nail's ability to regenerate lost limbs. Gohan and Krillin rescue Bulma from a dinosaur attack, and take the Dragon Radar to find where Frieza took the Dragon Balls to. As the episode ends, Ginyu makes the strange move of wounding himself, and firing a strange beam at Goku.</Overview>

  <Overview>After killing Jeice, Vegeta sets his sights on Ginyu (still in Goku's body.) Vegeta effortlessly pummels Ginyu, and an attempt by Ginyu to get Vegeta's body is thwarted by Goku who intervenes - ending up back in his own (wounded) body, and Ginyu going back to the body he had before - which he had deliberately wounded. Vegeta begins thrashing Ginyu in his native body, and once again quick thinking on Goku's part prevents Vegeta from being swapped with Ginyu's body - Goku throws a Namekian frog in the path of the beam, trapping Ginyu in the frog's body. Vegeta places Goku in a rejuvenation chamber inside Frieza's spaceship and gives armor to Krillin and Gohan - knowing an inevitable battle against Frieza is in their future. Vegeta begins sleeping to regain strength he lost while fighting Ginyu. Meanwhile, Nail continues to fight Frieza and does no damage to the tyrant. Once beaten and fallen, Nail reveals the truth - the fight was just a diversion to get the password to use the Dragon Balls to the Earthlings! Frieza begins charging back towards his spaceship, noticing his scouter no longer shows the power levels for the Ginyu Force. Krillin, Gohan, and Dende take the Dragon Balls, and Dende uses the password to summmon Porunga, the Namekian Dragon Balls' equivalent of Shenron.</Overview>

  <Overview>Porunga, the Namekian Eternal Dragon, is summoned. However Krillin, Gohan and Dende are met with some bad news when they discover that only one dead friend can be resurrected per wish! Piccolo communicates with the Earthlings, telling them to revive him and wish him to the Planet Namek. Dende speaks the first wish and Piccolo's halo disappears - and Kami is resurrected on Earth, much to Mr. Popo's joy. The second wish is made, however, Piccolo is nowhere in sight. Dende tells them that they wished him to the Planet Namek and not their specific location, however - so the third wish can be used to transport him to that particular spot. Unfortunately, things take a turn for the worst. Vegeta is awakened by sensing the approaching Frieza's power, and quickly awakens and rushes to where the Earthlings are making their wishes. He threatens them for stealing his chance at immortality, though they accidentally reveal that there is one more wish left - which he would be able to use to get immortality. He tells Dende to make him immortal, and with Frieza fast approaching, Krillin reluctantly tells Dende to wish Vegeta immortal - stating that, if nothing else, he is at least better than Frieza. Before he can deliver the wish, however, the Eldest Namek dies, causing the Dragon Balls to stop working. Vegeta is outraged at the Earthlings since his chance for immortality has one again been foiled. His anger at the Earthlings doesn't last, however, since Frieza arrives at the battlefield at that very moment. The tyrant begins charging up, terrifying everyone but Vegeta who seems strangely calm. The entire planet begins to shake violently as Frieza summons his power - as Goku remains in the rejuvenation chamber, slowly still recovering from the injuries his body had taken during the earlier Ginyu conflict.</Overview>

  <Overview>Piccolo arrives on Planet Namek following being resurrected and wished there. He begins rushing towards the battlefield, and along the way encounters an ailing Nail, on the brink of death. Piccolo reluctantly performs Namekian fusion with Nail, which increases his power substantially, and begins rushing back to the battlefield. Meanwhile, Frieza, after battling the Earthlings and Vegeta in his first form, transforms to his second form following some goading from Vegeta - and this increases the tyrant's power level to over a million! With his increased power, Frieza charges at Krillin in the air, impaling him on his horn.</Overview>

  <Overview>While Goku continues to recover in the rejuvenation chamber at Frieza's ship, Piccolo begins battling Frieza himself - and surprisingly manages to hold his own! The two exchange blows pretty evenly for a good portion of the fight. Piccolo realizes Frieza slightly holds the upper hand, so he removes his weighted clothing and begins winning against the tyrant. Frieza finds himself backed into a corner, so he decides it is best to transform again to fight Piccolo. Becoming his grotesque, ugly third form, Frieza once again gains the upper hand and begins obliterating Piccolo with a rapid finger beam blast. Gohan rushes to rescue his mentor, and when Krillin tries to follow suit, Vegeta stops him - revealing to Krillin he may have a strategy that will allow him to defeat the tyrant. </Overview>

  <Overview>Frieza dodges Gohan's attack but quickly finds himself on the receiving end once again - the young half Saiyan unleashes a massive energy blast that even the tyrant himself has difficulty deflecting! Upon seeing what he is up against in the form of these warriors who seem to be getting progressively stronger, Frieza begins transforming to his fourth form - the final and most powerful. Vegeta's plan to defeat Frieza involves having himself mortally wounded and then being healed by Dende - which the Saiyan prince achieves by having Krillin shoot an energy blast through his chest. Dende has no interest in healing Vegeta (who harmed so many of his people), however, and flies over to heal Piccolo instead. However, Nail's essence within Piccolo tells him that healing Vegeta may be the only way to win the fight - so Dende reluctantly does so. Frieza eventually reaches his final form, and immediately kills Dende with an energy blast - having witnessed his healing abilities while transforming. Krillin, Gohan, and Piccolo go on the attack but the tyrant dodges every single attack they throw his way. Vegeta watches them fight from a hill, preparing to charge up to his newfound power level as Gohan finds himself on a direct collision course with another one of Frieza's blasts.</Overview>

  <Overview>Ginyu tries to steal Piccolo's body, but is foiled by Gohan who throws the frog body back in the way, restoring he and Bulma back to the way they were. Meanwhile, Goku continues to be thrashed by Frieza. However, he sees a vision of how Frieza could destroy everything he knows and loves - and finds a new level of strength as a result! Goku lets loose with a massive Kamehameha that even Frieza himself has difficulty deflecting! Unfortunately, it isn't enough and Goku quickly finds himself of the receiving end again. Once again, he begins seeing a vision, this time of Vegeta and other Saiyans of the past, including his father Bardock. Motivated once again, he lunges at Frieza, powered up.</Overview>

  <Overview>Following Planet Namek's destruction, King Kai informs Bulma and the others on Earth of Goku's apparent death, and that even though the Namekian Dragon Balls can resurrect Goku and Krillin, they will be brought back to where Namek used to be and die again. However, Vegeta comes up with the idea of using the Dragon Balls to first bring Goku and Krillin's souls to the Earth's check-in station in the afterlife. 130 days later, the Namekian Dragon Balls are re-active, and the first two wishes are used to successfully revive Krillin, but it is revealed that Goku is still alive and that he will return to Earth on his own later. Yamcha is then brought back to life with the third wish. Another 130 days later, the Namekian Dragon Balls are used to revive both Tien and Chiaotzu, and are then used to teleport all of the Namekians (minus Piccolo) to a new planet. The Z Fighters then return to their peaceful lives, while waiting for Goku to return.</Overview>

  <Overview>After three hours of waiting, a space pod crash lands on Earth and Goku emerges from it. There is no time for celebration, however, as the mysterious teenager pulls Goku aside to talk with him in private. After testing Goku's Super Saiyan powers, the teenager reveals that his name is Trunks and that he comes from an apocolyptic future 20 years from the present, as well as that he is the future son of Bulma and Vegeta. He further informs Goku that in three years from now, a pair of deadly androids, built by Dr. Gero of the former Red Ribbon Army, will begin a rampage on Earth and kill all of the Z Fighters, except for Goku, who will die from a heart virus some time before their assault. Trunks then supplies Goku with a heart antidote that Future Bulma made for him, instructing him to take it when the virus attacks him. Goku promises that he and the other Z Fighters will train hard for the next three years to prepare for the androids' assault, and Trunks returns to the future in his time machine.</Overview>

  <Overview>Vegeta asks Goku how he managed to survive Planet Namek's destruction. Goku then explains that just seconds before Namek exploded, he found one of the Ginyu Force's space pods and used it to escape. He further explains that he eventually landed on Planet Yardrat and was nursed back to health by the friendly inhabitants of the planet. He also reveals that he learned from them a special teleportation technique called &quot;Instant Transmission.&quot; The Z Fighters then go their separate ways to each begin preparing themselves for the androids' assault. After three years of intense training, they all head off to meet on the island that Trunks informed Goku where the androids will begin their attack.</Overview>

  <Overview>The Z Fighters (plus Bulma with a young Trunks) gather at the island in anticipation of the androids' attack. However, as the time approaches, Gohan reasons that due to being artificial humans, their enemies have no readable ki and can therefore only be found visually. The fighters then descend into the nearby city to search out their enemies. After a period of searching, Yamcha becomes the first victim of the androids, after being impaled and having his energy absorbed by Android #20. The others arrive just in time to save him, and Goku eventually persuades the androids to move to a new location to fight after a large portion of the city is destroyed.</Overview>

  <Overview>As Goku, Piccolo and Tien take the androids to a new location to battle, Krillin revives Yamcha with a sensu bean. However, once Yamcha reveals the androids' ability to absorb energy, the three of them (Yamcha, Krillin and Gohan) head off to warn the others. Meanwhile, it is revealed to Goku that the androids are a result of years of research conducted by Dr. Gero, in which miniature spy robots were used to analyse Goku's fighting techniques and developments in strength, all in an attempt to exact revenge on Goku for destroying the Red Ribbon Army. As a battles ensues between Super Saiyan Goku and Android #19, it becomes evident that Goku is losing the upper hand, especially once the android absorbs Goku's Kamehameha wave. Gohan then reveals that Goku never became sick from the heart virus (as was predicted by Trunks), and that it seems to have affected him six months later than planned. As Goku struggles to fight, the android prepares to finish the battle by absorbing Goku's remaining energy.</Overview>

  <Overview>Before Android #19 can finish draining Goku's energy, Vegeta finally arrives, saving Goku by kicking the android in the face. Yamcha then escorts Goku away from the battlefield. Vegeta then squares up to the androids, and much to everyone's surprise, transforms into a Super Saiyan. It is revealed that whereas Goku's transformation was triggered by the desire to protect his friends and family, Vegeta's was triggered purely by the desire to become stronger, as well as his anger at being surpassed by Goku. The battle then begins, and it's clear that Vegeta has the edge over Android #19. Even the android's energy absorption attack proves futile, as Vegeta tears off the android's arms, making the technique impossible to use. As the android runs in fear, Vegeta launches his 'Big Bang Attack' and finishes the battle, leaving nothing but the android's head intact. Android 20 then escapes into the nearby cliffs, planning to use the terrain to launch a surprise attack on the fighters.</Overview>

  <Overview>The Z Fighters split up to search the area for Android #20. Frustrated at his enemy's deceptiveness, Vegeta fires a large ki blast at the cliffs, planning to level the area. Seeing this opportunity, Android #20 emerges from his hiding place, only to absorb Vegeta's blast and run away before Vegeta can catch up. He then attacks Piccolo from behind and begins to drain his energy, although this is thwarted by Gohan, who senses Piccolo's fading ki and attacks the android. After receiving a sensu bean, Piccolo then faces off against his attacker, and proves to be more than a match for the android. Meanwhile, Trunks finally returns from the future, and is disturbed to find that the remains of Android #19 are different from the androids that he faced in his own timeline. He then arrives at the current battlefield, and also seems not to recognise Android #20. Realising that he has no chance of victory, Android #20 decides to retreat to his laboratory, but not before launching a huge blast that engulfs most of the area - including Bulma's ship, which plummets towards the ground.</Overview>

  <Overview>As the dust settles, Android #20 is nowhere to be seen, and it is assumed that he plans to return to the laboratory and awaken Androids #17 and #18 - the androids causing havoc in Trunk's timeline. Meanwhile, Trunks rescues his mother and young self, and berates Vegeta for failing to protect his family. Bulma then reveals that Android #20 may actually be the androids' creator, Dr Gero, who has seemingly converted himself into one as well. The group then plan to find the lab and destroy the androids before Dr Gero can activate them. Vegeta also sets off to find the lab, but with the intentions of fighting the androids as a demonstration of his power. Trunks leaves to stop his father, while Piccolo finally unveils the truth of Trunk's origin to the rest of the group. Meanwhile, Piccolo, Krillin and Tien split up and search the mountains where Dr Gero's lab is rumoured to be located, while Gohan takes Bulma, baby Trunks and Yajrobe to Goku. Meanwhile, Krillin is attacked by the doctor, but is spared when Gero senses Piccolo nearby and escapes.</Overview>

  <Overview>Dr. Gero finally makes it to his laboratory, with Krillin in hot pursuit. Tien, Piccolo, Vegeta and Trunks soon locate him and break into the lab, although by this point Dr. Gero has already awakened Androids #17 and #18. Although initially appearing loyal, the duo demonstrate their independence when Android #17 destroys Gero's remote, ensuring that he cannot deactivate them should they disobey him, and Android #18 attempts to activate Android #16 - a fully mechanical model deemed a failure by Dr. Gero. Android #17 then kills Dr. Gero, by severing and then crushing his head. In an act of desperation, Trunks launches a large ki blast at the androids, hoping to destroy Android #16 before he is activated. Although the entire lab is decimated, both Androids and #16's pod remain intact, and he is awakened anyway. The trio then decide to carry out their initial orders, and set out to kill Goku. However, their plans are disrupted when Vegeta intervenes, challenging the three androids to a battle. After Android #16 refuses to fight, Android #18 steps up to face Vegeta.</Overview>

  <Overview>Back at Kami's house Chichi says that Goku is nearly healed. The monster uses the sting on his tail and starts sucking the life force out of a man which causes the man to melt away. The monster seems to know Piccolo's name and says that he is his brother. The others detect multiple Ki readings, seeming to come from many different people, including Goku, all gathered in one spot but everyone states that this is impossible and Gohan goes to check on Goku but he is still fast asleep in his bed. Krillin and Trunks start to head over to Gingertown meanwhile Piccolo and the monster starts fighting. The androids sense an atmospheric vibration and state that one of the power readings rivals Android 17's. The monster survives Piccolo's attack and then uses a Makankosappo  on him. Piccolo is shocked but deflects the attack. The monster says that the reason why Piccolo is beating him for now is because he has not achieved his 'perfect form' and the reason why he was sucking all life energy from the people in the town was to increase his own life energy. He also tells Piccolo that the person who sent him back into the time machine was himself;he had to revert himself back into egg form to fit inside the time machine. The monsters suprises Piccolo by using the Kamehameha  technique on Piccolo and then teleports behind Piccolo and starts sucking the life out of Piccolo's arm. Piccolo escapes with a shriveled arm by headbutting the monster in the head. The monster states that his name is Cell and that he is an android.</Overview>

  <Overview>Cell explains that he was born by the computer used by Doctor Gero. A long time ago Doctor Gero began collecting the cells of the greatest warriors to research how he could synthesize an android from these cells. However, because it was taking too much time, he gave up on it partway through but the computer continued its operation. Piccolo, Goku and Vegata's cells were collected at the battle when Vegeta first came to Earth. They also obtained Freeza and his father's cells when they came to Earth which explains all the different ki readings. A small spy robot, similar to Cell, was used to collect the cells while also collecting data and sending it to the computer but Piccolo destroyed it during the fight. Even though Doctor Gero's laboratory was destroyed, there was still a small room beneath the laboratory where the computer is. Cell furthermore explains how once he has turned back into an egg he requires three years underground to mature again and that he came back from the future because the absorption of human essence is not enough to achieve his perfect form; it is necessary for him to merge with two essential specialized life forms which the computer told Cell that they were the androids that Doctor Gero has created #17 and #18! In the future #17 and #18 weren't around but luckily Trunks had his time machine so he killed Trunks and came back to his era in search of #17 and #18. The reason why Cell chose this era was because Trunks's time machine already set for this era to warn the other about the androids so all Cell did was push the switch. The computer also told Cell that once he reaches his perfect form, he will have terrible power far greater than anymore imagined. After obtaining all of the information, Piccolo pulled off his shriveled arm and grew a new one. Just when Piccolo and Cell were about to fight Trunks and Krillin arrive. Realizing he has no chance of winning, Cell retreats by blinding them with Taiyoken and escapes to absorb more humans in the direction of Nickytown. Vegeta arrives at the scene and sees that the massive ki reading was Piccolo and when Tien finally arrives Piccolo explains to everyone what he has learnt from Cell. Meanwhile Cell is absorbing the life energy from passengers in a bus and plans to keep absorbing people till his power level is greater than #17 and the others and then he will make them merge with him for unimaginable power. </Overview>

Trunks and Krillin go to Dr.Gero's laboratory to destory the incomplete Cell so he will not be born in their dimension mean-whilst Piccolo and Cell stay behind to search the surroundings. Trunks and Krillin arrive and blast the pile of rubble with their ki and discovers a ladder which leads underneath the laboratory into a room containing the computer and the incomplete Cell. They search around and discover the blueprints for Android #17 then after they make sure to destroy all of the laboratory and the basement. Krillin takes the prints to Bulma's house whilst Trunks decides to go and train with Vegeta. Krillin delivers the prints leaving Bulma and her father to start finding a weak spot on Android #17. Krillin taking a short-cut back to Master Roshi's house encounters Cell who is just about to absorb his next victims, arrives in the nick of time to save them. Krillin being no match for Cell, tells the civilians to escape, then uses the Taiyoken technique to blind Cell in an attempt to escape by grabbing on to a plane but Cell quickly recovers and jumps on top of the plane and starts attacking Krillin again. Just when it seems hopeless for Krillin, Piccolo and Tien arrive to save Krillin. Cell sensing their arrival flees while hiding his presence so no one can track him. 2-3 days later, the news continues to report about Cell's killings. Everyone decides to ride in a hovercraft to reach Cell so that he will not be able to sense them approaching him. Back at Kami's house there is a loud rumble causing Chichi to go and check on Goku but on arrival sees Goku is gone. She looks out of the window and sees that Goku is outside and that it was Goku making the loud noise by performing the Kamehameha technique. Goku tells Chichi that he has fully recovered of the illness and that he knows everything that is going on because he read everyone's minds whilst he was dreaming but says that he plans on training to surpass a Super Saiyan before going off to fight Cell. </Overview>

  <Overview>As Piccolo completes his training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber and Vegeta takes his place, Goku and Gohan are spending their days relaxing at home. Meanwhile, the Self-Defense Army attempt to launch an offensive strike against Cell, but they are completely wiped out. Hearing about this over the radio, Goku asks Picollo if it is possible to seperate with Kami, so he can use the Dragonballs to revive all the people Cell killed (as they disappeared since they fused together). Since Piccolo can't seperate, Goku theorises that he can convince another Namekian to stay on Earth and create a new set of Dragonballs, and goes to find King Kai so he can find the Namekians.</Overview>

  <Overview>After getting help from King Kai in locating the planet where the Namekians are staying, Goku travels there and explains the situation. The Grand Elder offers Dende to be the new Kami, and Goku takes him back to Earth. Dende revives the dragon balls, revealing that this time they can use two wishes. During the the ten days leading up to the Cell Games, Goku searches for the newly awakened dragon balls, Vegeta and the others finish their training and a martial arts champion, Hercule, steps up to fight Cell. On the day of the Cell Games, it is revealed that if the new dragon balls are used to revive a mass of people, people who died before won't be revived. Despite the others' concern, Goku remains positive and they all head towards the Cell Games.</Overview>

  <Overview>Goku and Cell begin to fight and, despite putting on an impressive performance, Gohan and Vegeta both realise that neither is using his full power yet. Both fighters then raise their ki to their maximum. After a brief battle, Cell begins to attack using techniques 'inherited' from other characters--first Tien's Multi-Form technique, then Piccolo's Makankosappo, and finally Frieza's homing Destructo Disc. When Goku overcomes each of these techniques, Cell prepares a full-power Kamehameha capable of destroying the Earth. Goku diverts the attack away from the planet by taking to the sky, and then uses Instant Transmission to return to escape back to the ring.</Overview>

  <Overview>The battle between Goku and Cell continues, with the two fighters reaching a pace that is barely visible to most of the onlookers. Cell then decides to destroy the tournament ring, ensuring that their battle isn't ended by a ring out and can continue until one of them either dies or surrenders. The battle becomes even more intense, culminating with Goku flying high into the sky building up a powerful Kamehameha. Cell and everyone else states that Goku is bluffing, since from his position in the sky, such an attack would easily destroy the Earth. Goku then unexpectedly uses Instant Transmission to teleport in front of Cell and executes the attack point-blank. While the rest of the world celebrates what they believe to be Cell's ultimate defeat, Goku and company watch as Cell's remaining lower half rises and regenerates his missing parts. While the ki of both fighters has depleted considerably, the battle continues on.</Overview>

  <Overview>Gohan shows no willingness to fight, and explains to Cell his reason - whenever he is in battle, he loses control and goes in an all out rage. Unfortunately, this intrigues Cell, and so he decides to enrage the boy by inflicting enough pain to force him to unleash his true strength. After watching Gohan take Cell's punishment, #16 decides to intervene by grabbing Cell and activating the bomb within his own body. Unfortunately, Krillin reveals that while repairing him, Bulma removed #16's bomb, which renders his intervention futile. Cell quickly breaks free of #16's hold, causing his body to shatter - leaving only his head intact. When Cell realizes his attempts at physical intimidation are failing, he devises a plan to attack the ones that are closest to Gohan by spawning seven offspring - the Cell Jr.'s.</Overview>

  <Overview>Gohan's reluctance reaches it's limit, and #16 asks Mr Satan to carry him over to Gohan to talk to him. #16 explains to Gohan what to fight for, and that it is okay to unleash his anger to save those that he loves. After hearing his words of encouragement, Cell takes his foot and crushes #16's head. Seeing this is ultimately the last straw for Gohan, who finally releases his rage and ascends to the Super Saiyan 2 level. Gohan then turns his attention to the Cell Jr.s, taking them out one-by-one.</Overview>

  <Overview>Cell finally unleashes his full power against Gohan, but even at maximum strength his attacks have no effect on the Super Saiyan 2. After being easily bested in battle, Cell attempts to destroy Gohan and the Earth with a giant Kamehameha, but Gohan produces an even larger wave and deflects the attack with ease. As the rest of the fighters predict an easy victory, Goku recalls that even in the Room of Spirit and Time, Gohan displayed strength far beyond that of a normal Super Saiyan. He then tells Gohan to deliver the finishing blow to Cell, but Gohan insists that Cell must suffer first. Cell then utilises his bulked-up transformation, but the increase in muscle mass lowers his speed greatly and as a result none of his attacks connect with Gohan - who counters with a single blow to the stomach, causing Cell to regurgitate Android 18 and revert back to his semi-perfect form. As the fighters assume that this means victory for Gohan, Cell's body begins to expand to a gigantic size.</Overview>

  <Overview>Cell continues to charge his Kamehameha, and reveals that not only has he gathered enough energy to destroy the Earth, but he also now has the potential to destroy the entire solar system with this blast. Meanwhile, Vegeta apologises to Gohan for his recklessness. As Gohan and the others watch on in hopelessness, Goku contacts his son from the afterlife and tells him that even in his injured state he has the potential to defeat Cell. Reinvigorated, Gohan prepares a final, one-handed Kamehameha to repel Cell's blast. As the two warriors struggle to overpower each other, Piccolo, Tien, Yamcha and Krillin bombard Cell with ki blasts in a knowingly futile attempt to help, but are easily repelled. As Goku coaxes Gohan to release his full power against Cell, Vegeta returns to the battlefield and launches one final Big Bang Attack, which temporarily distracts Cell. Seeing the opportunity, Gohan finally releases his full strength and overpowers Cell's wave, obliterating Cell's body and and saving the Earth from destruction. Gohan has won and the Cell Games are finally over. </Overview>

  <Overview>After Gohan spreads word of the tournament to the others, as well as managing to convince Chi-Chi to let him participate himself, Gohan takes a leave of absence from school and begins training with Goten. Gohan is surprised to find that Goten not only possesses great strength, but is also already capable of transforming into a Super Saiyan, although he has yet to learn how to fly. Later, Videl comes around to have Gohan make good on his promise to teach her how to fly using bukÅ«-jutsu, with Gohan starting her off with the basics of learning how to control her energy. Within a day, Videl has managed to learn how to float while Goten has managed to learn how to fly. Following a remark from Gohan, Videl comes back the next day with her hair cut, determined to learn more from Gohan. Meanwhile, Vegeta is also surprised to find that Trunks is also capable of becoming a Super Saiyan, whose strength is slightly higher than Goten's, while Goku trains fiercely in anticipation for the tournament. </Overview>

  <Overview>After ten days of training, Videl manages to master flight, finally giving Gohan and Goten the opportunity to resume their training for the tournament. On the day of the tournament, Gohan suggests to Vegeta, Goten, and Trunks that they don't use their Super Saiyan forms during the tournament to avoid hassle from the press. Arriving at the island where the tournament will take place, Gohan and the others are greeted by Goku, who the fortune teller Baba has granted 24 hours to stay on Earth, allowing him to meet Goten for the first time, while Piccolo destroys all the cameras in the area to keep Gohan's identity a secret. After the participating fighters register for the tournament, with Goten and Trunks forced to participate in the junior division, the preliminary rounds begin, where the fighters must hit a punching machine to rank their strength, with the Dragon Team effortlessly qualifying. </Overview>

  <Overview>As the drawings come to a close, Piccolo is put up against Shin while #18 is up against Satan. After Krillin wins his first match against his opponent, Piccolo and Shin face against each other, but as Piccolo senses an overwhelming power coming from Shin, he decides to forfeit the match before it even begins, feeling Shin's power is far beyond his own. As Videl prepares to go up against a man named Spopovitch, Piccolo learns from Kibito that Shin is actually the Supreme Kai, believed to be even more powerful than the Grand Kai. Videl appears to get the upper hand in her match, but Spopovitch keeps getting up no matter how many times he is knocked down and eventually fights back. Goku suspects something amiss about Spopovitch, which proves true when he continues fighting even after Videl breaks his neck. Videl attempts to use her flight to regain her strength, but Spopovitch follows her into the air and uses energy blasts against her. As Videl refuses to give up despite the beating she is taking, Goku wonders where Spopovitch got his power from. </Overview>

  <Overview>With Spopovich nearly beating Videl to death, Gohan loses his temper and prepares to storm onto the field, but Spopovich's partner, Yamu, convinces Spopovich to end the fight by pushing Videl out of the ring. With Videl heavily injured, Goku uses his instant transmission to receive some senzu beans from Korin, which Gohan gives to Videl to restore her to full health. Gohan, whose identity is revealed to his classmates after his bandana was blown off during his outburst, steps up to face against Kibito, who requests to see Gohan's Super Saiyan transformation. After Piccolo informs the other Z-Fighters of Shin's identity as the Supreme Kai, he orders Gohan to transform. Right after Gohan transforms, Spopovich and Yamu appear and use a device to drain his Super Saiyan energy, leaving him weakened. As Kibito offers to tend to Gohan, the Supreme Kai asks Goku and the others to join him in pursuing the culprits. </Overview>

  <Overview>As Goku and the others set off to join the Supreme Kai, Kibito uses his unique ability to restore Gohan's energy, before the two of them, along with Videl, set off after the others. Along the way, Supreme Kai and Kibito explain to the others about how an evil mage named Babidi is seeking to revive an evil being known as Majin Buu, who was responsible for the death of four Supreme Kais long ago. To accomplish this, he manipulated Spopovich and Yamu to join the tournament and steal Super Saiyan energy needed to break the seal placed on Buu. Unable to push her flight any further, Videl, coming to understand that Gohan was the one who defeated Cell back then, places her faith in him and returns to the tournament grounds, while Gohan and Kibito catch up to Goku's group. Arriving at the site of a buried spaceship, the Z-Fighters lay in watch as Spopovich and Yamu deliver Gohan's energy to Babidi and his partner, Dabura, the Demon King. </Overview>

  <Overview>Supreme Kai and Kibito warn Goku and the others about the malicious pair, with Dabura being the strongest being of the underworld and Babidi possessing magic powerful enough to sway him to become his henchman. Having obtained the energy from them and deeming them of no further use, Babidi kills Spopovich with his magic while having his other henchman, Pui Pui, kill Yamu. Having detected the presence of the Z-Fighters, Babidi and Pui Pui head inside of the ship while Dabura attacks the group, immediately killing Kibito and firing his spit at Krillin and Piccolo, turning them into stone. Learning that they can only unpetrify them by killing Dabura, the remaining fighters chase after him into the ship, despite Supreme Kai's warnings. Upon reaching the first floor, they are confronted by Pui Pui, who informs them they must face several floors before they can reach Babidi at the bottom. The Saiyans, however, don't think much of their opponent and play a game of rock-paper-scissors to decide who should fight him, with Vegeta stepping up against him. </Overview>

  <Overview>As Vegeta easily outmatches Pui Pui in terms of fighting skill, Babidi changes the stage to match that of the high gravity planet, Zun, where Pui Pui is at his top fighting form. However, this makes no difference to Vegeta, who obliterates his opponent and opens the way to the next floor. Believing the Saiyans to not be underestimated, Babidi sends in his next warrior, Yakon, and changes the stage to that of Planet Ankoku, but even with the aid of pitch black darkness, Yakon is no match for Goku's keen senses. When Goku turns Super Saiyan, however, Yakon uses his ability to consume light and sucks in Goku's energy, turning him back into normal. Rather than finding an alternative way to fight, Goku instead feeds him even more Saiyan energy until he explodes from being overloaded, allowing Goku and the others to move onto the next stage. </Overview>

  <Overview>Vegeta begins his attack on Goku, killing several innocent people in the crowd without any remorse. Realising Vegeta had fallen under Babidi's spell on purpose purely for the sake of his grudge, Goku is left with no choice but to fight against him, despite Supreme Kai's attempt to stop him, and has Babidi warp them to somewhere they can fight alone. As Supreme Kai and Gohan decide to go on ahead and leave the two Saiyans to their fight, Babidi attempts to command Vegeta to kill them, but his pride defies even his master's demands. </Overview>

  <Overview>Goku and Vegeta's fight continues to escalate, with Vegeta revealing he chose to go under Babidi's control in order to gain the strength to face against Goku, feeling he needed to get rid of his gentle side. Meanwhile, as the seal containing Majin Buu starts to be break, Gohan attempts to stop him reaching full power by shooting multiple Kamehameha Waves at the egg. The egg splits apart with seemingly nothing more than pink smoke coming out of it, leading Supreme Kai to presume Majin Buu had been destroyed. However, Gohan senses a powerful energy from the smoke, which forms together to make Majin Buu, who appears to be nothing more than a mere child. </Overview>

  <Overview>Everyone seems to be bewildered by Buu's childlike behavior, curious as to whether his rebirth was actually unsuccessful. However, Buu soon shows off his frightening strength when he effortlessly beats Dabura, the rise in his power level even catching the attention of the other Saiyans. Although Goku tries to convince Vegeta to postpone the fight in order to stop Buu, Vegeta knocks out Goku when he drops his guard, taking a senzu bean and setting off to fight Buu himself. Gohan and Supreme Kai attempt to flee from Buu, but he easily catches up to them, proving himself immune to Supreme Kai's attacks. </Overview>

  <Overview>Buu completely overwhelms Supreme Kai and Gohan, with Supreme Kai using the last of his strength to make sure Gohan survives Buu's attack. Before Buu can finish Supreme Kai, he is attacked by Dabura, who believes he cannot be made to obey anyone. Meanwhile, Goten and Trunks arrive nearby, inadvertently breaking the petrified Piccolo. Unfazed by Dabura's attacks, Buu uses his unique ability to turn Dabura into a cookie and eats him, undoing the petrification on Krillin and Piccolo, the latter of whom survived being broken thanks to his regenerative abilities. Before Buu can do the same to Supreme Kai, Vegeta arrives on the scene. </Overview>

  <Overview>As Bulma and the others from the stadium follow Videl's directions in pursuit of Goten and Trunks, they are hit by the shockwave from Vegeta's attack and almost crash, but are saved by #18. Piccolo leaves Goten and Trunks with Krillin, telling him to inform the others that Vegeta and possibly Gohan have been killed, before he investigates the site of Vegeta's sacrificial attack, finding various charred fragments of Buu, along with Babidi, who narrowly survived the explosion. However, Piccolo is shocked to witness Buu's fragments suddenly come to life and reassemble to bring Buu back to his normal form. As Buu uses his power to heal Babidi, who vows to make the planet suffer, Piccolo decides to take Goten and Trunks up to Kami's tower. Elsewhere, Goku regains conciousness and tries to determine the situation, while a weakened Supreme Kai searches for Gohan, whose fate is still unknown. </Overview>

  <Overview>Bulma's group goes to seek out the Dragon Balls so they can revive all the spectators that Vegeta killed, coming up against a large dragon whilst trying to get the last one. Meanwhile, as Piccolo and Krillin as they leave Goten and Trunks in the care of Dende and Mr. Popo, they are soon joined by Goku, who learns about the situation. Goku states he isn't strong enough to defeat Buu, but mentions having learned a technique known as Fusion, in which two similarly built fighters can merge together to become a single powerful fighter. Though he had originally planned to do this himself with either Gohan or Vegeta, Goku realises from Mr. Popo that he can instead teach this technique to Goten and Trunks, due to their similar size. </Overview>

  <Overview>Using the Dragon Balls, Bulma summons out Shenron, using one of its wishes to bring back everyone who had been killed that day. As using all three wishes would mean they would have to wait another year before they can use the Dragon Balls again, Goku warps over to Bulma's group and convinces Shenron to postpone the other two wishes, shortening that time to four months. Kibito, who was revived by the wish, manages to find Supreme Kai and heal his injuries, and together they manage to find Gohan and decide to bring him to the world of the Kais. Meanwhile, Goku warps Bulma and the others to Kami's Palace, where he informs them of the grim situation concerning Gohan and Vegeta, before Babidi announces his message to the world. </Overview>
